# Claude Ando Creative Portfolio 2022

This website was designed in Figma, developed in React.js, deployed in AWS, pipelined with CircleCI.
The purpose of this website is to showcase my various skillsets in software development, and creative visions I have as a developer. 


Over the next couple of months, I am migrating the static assets to AWS S3 bucket to optimise the load speed and SEO.


Technology: React.js / p5.js / JavaScript / CSS / HTML / AWS (Route53, EC2 (Ubuntu), ACM...) / CircleCI / Google Analytics
