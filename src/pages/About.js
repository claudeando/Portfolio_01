                <p className="aboutDescription1">Born in London, grew up in Japan, interned in UAE, educated in the UK,
                    taught myself Mandarin to create documentary films with CGTN. I grew to think outside
                    the box with the multinational mindset.
                    In the software enginnering world, I am a bit of a weird one coming from the creative industry. My
                    niche lies in my creative visons coupled with technical skillsets in various mediums. For about 10
                    years, I have been in the creative industry, starting from 2015 working as a assistant fashion
                    designer in Tokyo, from 2018 freelance photograpgher and videographer at university. Now the
                    creative skillsets developed to software development. <br /><br />
                    I have directed, designed, and developed web applications for talented individuals and small-to-mid-sized businesses. Launched a tech startup, nocturna.io and desined, and developed a web3 integration SASS toolkit.
                    My artwork has been featured by well-known magazines such as Vogue
                    Italia, The Independent Photo, Palatinate by Durham University. <br /><br />
                    Outside design / development work, I love investing my time in more projects such as creating
                    digital art pieces, having a constructive conversation, brainstormig business ideas, or launching
                    random but serious projects with talented people around me.
